**On Windows**
start the mongod service by typing into an admin cmd promt window like so
c:\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe //(path-to-mongod)
then open another cmd promt window and type
c:\mongodb\bin\mongo.exe


**If you get the 10061 error message**
change directory to root drive "C:\", and type the command below into an admin cmd prompt window,

c:\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe --config c:\mongodb\mongod.cfg --install

then type net start MongoDB you will get the message "The Mongo DB service was started successfully"

Then go to the control panel Start>Administrative Tools>Services, scroll to Mongo DB in the list of services and change start up type to automatic, if you so desire. Press ok.

Now type c:\mongodb\bin\mongo.exe and you should be connected to the Mongo test DB.
